**List Methods (2)**

Most list methods will change the list they're called on. Examples are:

+ [**`append()`**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq-mutable), that adds an element to the list it is called on,
+ [**`remove()`**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq-mutable), that removes the first element of a list that matches the input, and
+ [**`reverse()`**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq-mutable), that reverses the order of the elements in the list it is called on.

You'll be working on the list with the area of different parts of the house: `areas`.
