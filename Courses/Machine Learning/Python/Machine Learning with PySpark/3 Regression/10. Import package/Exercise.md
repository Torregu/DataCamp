**Import package**

As a data scientist, some notions of geometry never hurt. Let's refresh some of the basics.

For a fancy clustering algorithm, you want to find the circumference, $C$, and area, $A$, of a circle. When the radius of the circle is `r`, you can calculate $C$ and $A$ as:

$$
C=2\pi r
$$

$$
A=\pi r^2
$$

To use the constant `pi`, you'll need the `math` package. A variable `r` is already coded in the script. Fill in the code to calculate `C` and `A` and see how the [**`print()`**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print) functions create some nice printouts.
