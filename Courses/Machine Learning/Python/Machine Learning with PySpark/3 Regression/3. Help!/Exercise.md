**Help!**

Maybe you already know the name of a Python function, but you still have to figure out how to use it. Ironically, you have to ask for information about a function with another function: [**`help()`**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#help). In IPython specifically, you can also use `?` before the function name.

To get help on the [**max()**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#max) function, for example, you can use one of these calls:

```
help(max)
?max
```

Use the IPython Shell to open up the documentation on [**`pow()`**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#pow). Which of the following statements is true?
