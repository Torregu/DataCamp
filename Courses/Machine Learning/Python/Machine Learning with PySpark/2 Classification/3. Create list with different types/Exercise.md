**Create list with different types**

A list can contain any Python type. Although it's not really common, a list can also contain a mix of Python types including strings, floats, booleans, etc.

The printout of the previous exercise wasn't really satisfying. It's just a list of numbers representing the areas, but you can't tell which area corresponds to which part of your house.

The code in the editor is the start of a solution. For some of the areas, the name of the corresponding room is already placed in front. Pay attention here! `"bathroom"` is a string, while `bath` is a variable that represents the float `9.50` you specified earlier.
