**List of lists**

As a data scientist, you'll often be dealing with a lot of data, and it will make sense to group some of this data.

Instead of creating a flat list containing strings and floats, representing the names and areas of the rooms in your house, you can create a list of lists. The script in the editor can already give you an idea.

Don't get confused here: `"hallway"` is a string, while `hall` is a variable that represents the float `11.25` you specified earlier.
