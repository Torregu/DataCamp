**Subset and calculate**

After you've extracted values from a list, you can use them to perform additional calculations. Take this example, where the second and fourth element of a list `x` are extracted. The strings that result are pasted together using the `+` operator:

```
x = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
print(x[1] + x[3])
```
