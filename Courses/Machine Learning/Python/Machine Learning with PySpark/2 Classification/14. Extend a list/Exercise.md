**Extend a list**

If you can change elements in a list, you sure want to be able to add elements to it, right? You can use the `+` operator:

```
x = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
y = x + ["e", "f"]
```

You just won the lottery, awesome! You decide to build a poolhouse and a garage. Can you add the information to the `areas` list?
