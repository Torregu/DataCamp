**Guess the type**

To find out the type of a value or a variable that refers to that value, you can use the [**`type()`**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#type) function. Suppose you've defined a variable `a`, but you forgot the type of this variable. To determine the type of `a`, simply execute:

```
type(a)
```

We already went ahead and created three variables: `a`, `b` and `c`. You can use the IPython shell to discover their type. Which of the following options is correct?
