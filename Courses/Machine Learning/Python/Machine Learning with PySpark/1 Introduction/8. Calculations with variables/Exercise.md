**Calculations with variables**

Remember how you calculated the money you ended up with after 7 years of investing \$100? You did something like this:

```
100 * 1.1 ** 7
```

Instead of calculating with the actual values, you can use variables instead. The `savings` variable you've created in the previous exercise represents the \$100 you started with. It's up to you to create a new variable to represent `1.1` and then redo the calculations!
