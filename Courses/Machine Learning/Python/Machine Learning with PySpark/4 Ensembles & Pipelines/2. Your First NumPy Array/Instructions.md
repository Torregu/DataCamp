+ Import the `numpy` package as `np`, so that you can refer to `numpy` with `np`.
+ Use [**`np.array()`**](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/glossary.html#term-array) to create a `numpy` array from `baseball`. Name this array `np_baseball`.
+ Print out the type of `np_baseball` to check that you got it right.
