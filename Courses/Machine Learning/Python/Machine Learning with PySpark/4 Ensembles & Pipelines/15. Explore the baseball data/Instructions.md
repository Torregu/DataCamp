+ The code to print out the mean height is already included. Complete the code for the median height. Replace `None` with the correct code.
+ Use [**`np.std()`**](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/reference/generated/numpy.std.html) on the first column of `np_baseball` to calculate `stddev`. Replace `None` with the correct code.
+ Do big players tend to be heavier? Use [**`np.corrcoef()`**](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/reference/generated/numpy.corrcoef.html) to store the correlation between the first and second column of `np_baseball` in `corr`. Replace `None` with the correct code.
