**Baseball players' height**

You are a huge baseball fan. You decide to call the MLB (Major League Baseball) and ask around for some more statistics on the height of the main players. They pass along data on more than a thousand players, which is stored as a regular Python list: `height_in`. The height is expressed in inches. Can you make a `numpy` array out of it and convert the units to meters?

`height_in` is already available and the `numpy` package is loaded, so you can start straight away (Source: [**stat.ucla.edu**](https://wiki.stat.ucla.edu/socr/index.php/SOCR_Data_MLB_HeightsWeights)).
