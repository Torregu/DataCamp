+ Create a `numpy` array from the `weight_lb` list with the correct units. Multiply by `0.453592` to go from pounds to kilograms. Store the resulting `numpy` array as `np_weight_kg`.
+ Use `np_height_m` and `np_weight_kg` to calculate the BMI of each player. Use the following equation:
 
$$
\text{BMI}=\frac{\text{weight(kg)}}{\text{height(m)}^2}
$$

+ Save the resulting numpy array as bmi.
+ Print out bmi.
