**Baseball player's BMI**

The MLB also offers to let you analyze their weight data. Again, both are available as regular Python lists: `height_in` and `weight_lb`. `height_in` is in inches and `weight_lb` is in pounds.

It's now possible to calculate the BMI of each baseball player. Python code to convert `height_in` to a `numpy` array with the correct units is already available in the workspace. Follow the instructions step by step and finish the game!
