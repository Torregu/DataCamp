**Average versus median**

You now know how to use `numpy` functions to get a better feeling for your data. It basically comes down to importing `numpy` and then calling several simple functions on the `numpy` arrays:

```
import numpy as np
x = [1, 4, 8, 10, 12]
np.mean(x)
np.median(x)
```

The baseball data is available as a 2D `numpy` array with 3 columns (height, weight, age) and 1015 rows. The name of this `numpy` array is `np_baseball`. After restructuring the data, however, you notice that some height values are abnormally high. Follow the instructions and discover which summary statistic is best suited if you're dealing with so-called *outliers*.
