**Your First 2D NumPy Array**

Before working on the actual MLB data, let's try to create a 2D `numpy` array from a small list of lists.

In this exercise, `baseball` is a list of lists. The main list contains 4 elements. Each of these elements is a list containing the height and the weight of 4 baseball players, in this order. `baseball` is already coded for you in the script.
