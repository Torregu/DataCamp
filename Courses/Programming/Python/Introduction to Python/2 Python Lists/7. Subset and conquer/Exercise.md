**Subset and conquer**

Subsetting Python lists is a piece of cake. Take the code sample below, which creates a list `x` and then selects "b" from it. Remember that this is the second element, so it has index 1. You can also use negative indexing.

```
x = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
x[1]
x[-3] # same result!
```

Remember the `areas` list from before, containing both strings and floats? Its definition is already in the script. Can you add the correct code to do some Python subsetting?
