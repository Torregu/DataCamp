**List Methods**

Strings are not the only Python types that have methods associated with them. Lists, floats, integers and booleans are also types that come packaged with a bunch of useful methods. In this exercise, you'll be experimenting with:

+ [**`index()`**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.index), to get the index of the first element of a list that matches its input and
+ [**`count()`**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.count), to get the number of times an element appears in a list.

You'll be working on the list with the area of different parts of a house: `areas`.
