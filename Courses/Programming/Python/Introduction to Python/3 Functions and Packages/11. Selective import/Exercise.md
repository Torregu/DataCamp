**Selective import**

General imports, like `import math`, make **all** functionality from the `math` package available to you. However, if you decide to only use a specific part of a package, you can always make your import more selective:

```
from math import pi
```

Let's say the Moon's orbit around planet Earth is a perfect circle, with a radius `r` (in km) that is defined in the script.
