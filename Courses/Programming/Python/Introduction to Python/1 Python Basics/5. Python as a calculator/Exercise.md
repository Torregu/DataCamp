**Python as a calculator**

Python is perfectly suited to do basic calculations. Apart from addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, there is also support for more advanced operations such as:

+ Exponentiation: `**`. This operator raises the number to its left to the power of the number to its right. For example `4**2` will give `16`.
+ Modulo: `%`. This operator returns the remainder of the division of the number to the left by the number on its right. For example `18 % 7` equals `4`.

The code in the script gives some examples.
