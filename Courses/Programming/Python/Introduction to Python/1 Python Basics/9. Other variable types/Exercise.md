**Other variable types**

In the previous exercise, you worked with two Python data types:

+ `int`, or integer: a number without a fractional part. <br> 
  `savings`, with the value `100`, is an example of an integer.
+ `float`, or floating point: a number that has both an integer and fractional part, separated by a point. <br>
  `growth_multiplier`, with the value `1.1`, is an example of a float.

Next to numerical data types, there are two other very common data types:

+ `str`, or string: a type to represent text. You can use single or double quotes to build a string.
+ `bool`, or boolean: a type to represent logical values. Can only be `True` or `False` (the capitalization is important!).
