CAREER TRACK
# Data Scientist with R

Gain the career-building R skills you need to succeed as a data scientist. No prior coding experience required.

In this track, you’ll learn how this versatile language allows you to import, clean, manipulate, and visualize data—all integral skills for any aspiring data professional or researcher. Through interactive exercises, you’ll get hands-on with some of the most popular R packages, including ggplot2 and tidyverse packages like dplyr and readr. You’ll then work with real-world datasets to learn the statistical and machine learning techniques you need to write your own functions and perform cluster analysis. Start this track, grow your R skills, and begin your journey to becoming a confident data scientist.
