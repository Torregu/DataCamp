R is a tool for doing serious statistics and data analysis. But not everything in life can be serious, life is also beautiful, and R can make beautiful things too. R can make art.

The arrangement of leaves on a plant stem is ruled by spirals. This fact is called [phyllotaxis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phyllotaxis) and it is a nice example of how mathematics can describe patterns in nature. In this project, we will invent flowers using this fact.

This R project assumes you have familiarity with the `ggplot2` package. If you want to see more examples of how you can use R to make art, you should check out [the Fronkonstin blog](https://fronkonstin.com/) created by Antonio Sánchez Chinchón.

1. Patterns in nature
2. Warming up: drawing points on a circle
3. Make it harmonious with the Golden Angle
4. Remove everything unnecessary
5. A bit of makeup: size, color and transparency
6. Play with aesthetics: the dandelion
7. Put all it together: the sunflower
8. What if you modify the angle?
9. All together now: imaginary flowers
