This is an introduction to DataCamp projects. DataCamp projects allow you to apply the skills you have learned in DataCamp courses. In each project, you will carry out an end-to-end analysis on real-world tasks using real-world tools and workflows.

In doing so, you will learn how to work with Jupyter notebooks: an open-source web application that is great for interactive data analysis.
