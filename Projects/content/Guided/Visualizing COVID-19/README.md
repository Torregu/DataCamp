Apply data-wrangling and visualization tools from the tidyverse to musical data. Find the most common chords and chord progressions in a sample of pop/rock music from the 1950s-1990s, and compare the styles of different artists.

This project assumes familiarity with standard TidyVerse tools for R, in particular the `tibble` data structure and the `dplyr` and `ggplot2` packages. No specific musical knowledge is required, though it may give you ideas for further exploration of the dataset after completing the project.

This project uses a parsed and cleaned version of the [**McGill Billboard Dataset**](http://ddmal.music.mcgill.ca/research/billboard), version 2.0 (CC0 license).
